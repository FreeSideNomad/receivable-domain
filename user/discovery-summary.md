# Domain Model Discovery - Summary

## What I've Done

### 1. Process Documentation (`wiki/meta.md`)
Created a comprehensive process document that tracks:
- The 5-phase discovery process (Research â†’ Domain ID â†’ Context Definition â†’ Tactical Modeling â†’ Documentation)
- Key findings from vision.md analysis
- DDD framework reference
- Feedback loop tracker
- Decision log template
- Open questions list

### 2. Discovery Questions (`user/discovery-questions.md`)
Formulated 40+ targeted questions organized into 8 sections:

**Strategic Questions:**
- Domain classification (Core vs Supporting vs Generic)
- Bounded context identification
- Integration patterns

**Tactical Questions:**
- Key domain objects and their identities
- Aggregate boundaries (what must be consistent together?)
- Business rules and invariants

**Process Questions:**
- Cross-context workflows
- External system integration
- Future evolution considerations

### 3. Initial Analysis

Based on vision.md, I've identified these **potential domains**:

1. **Receivables Management** (likely Core)
   - Your competitive differentiator
   - Invoice lifecycle, approval workflows

2. **Payment Processing** (Core or Supporting?)
   - ACH generation, returns handling
   - Needs clarification on how differentiating this is

3. **Payor Relationship Management** (Supporting)
   - Onboarding, profile management
   - Necessary but not differentiating

4. **Identity & Access** (Generic)
   - Okta-based authentication
   - Could be off-the-shelf

5. **Banking Integration** (Supporting)
   - Extends existing online banking
   - Integration layer

And these **potential bounded contexts**:
- Receivables Context
- Payment Context
- Payor Context
- Approval & Workflow Context
- Identity & Access Context

## Next Steps

### Option A: Answer Questions Now
Review `/user/discovery-questions.md` and answer what you can. I've marked priority:
- ðŸ”´ **Critical** - Answer these first (4 questions)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Important** - Answer when you can (4 questions)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Nice to Have** - Can defer (2 questions)

### Option B: Stakeholder Workshop
Some questions may require domain experts or stakeholders. We can:
1. Identify which questions need their input
2. Schedule a discovery workshop
3. Use questions as discussion guide

### Option C: Iterate Incrementally
Start with what we know:
1. I create initial `project-ddd.md` based on vision.md alone
2. Document assumptions
3. You provide corrections/clarifications
4. We iterate through feedback loops

## Recommended Approach

I suggest **Option C** - let me create a first draft based on what I can infer from vision.md:

**Assumptions I'll make:**
- Receivables Management is the Core Domain
- Invoice, Payment, Payor, and Identity are separate bounded contexts
- Standard ACH processing is Supporting Domain
- Small aggregates (Invoice, Payment, Payor as separate aggregate roots)

**You then:**
- Review the draft
- Correct my assumptions
- Answer specific questions that arise
- We iterate to refine

This gets us to concrete artifacts faster, which are easier to critique than abstract questions.

## Deliverables

Once we complete discovery, you'll have:

1. **`wiki/project-ddd.md`** - Complete domain model in Markdown:
   - Domain classification with strategic importance
   - Bounded contexts with ubiquitous language
   - Aggregate definitions
   - Entity and value object models
   - Domain events
   - Context mapping relationships

2. **`wiki/project-ddd.yaml`** - Machine-readable version:
   - Follows ddd-schema-definition.yaml format
   - Can be used for code generation
   - Enables tooling and validation

3. **`wiki/meta.md`** - Living process document:
   - Tracks all decisions made
   - Documents feedback loops
   - Records open questions
   - Captures rationale

## What Do You Prefer?

Please let me know:
1. **Option A**: You'll answer the discovery questions first
2. **Option B**: We need a stakeholder workshop
3. **Option C**: I create first draft for you to review (recommended)

Or if you have a different approach in mind, I'm happy to adapt!
