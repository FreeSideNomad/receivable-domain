# Product Vision: Payment Receivables Platform

**Version**: 0.2 (Draft)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Discovery Phase - Solution Details Defined

## Executive Summary

We are building a Payment Receivables Platform that streamlines the invoice approval and payment collection process for existing bank customers (receivable customers) who supply goods and services to multiple companies (payors). By leveraging ACH pre-approved debit and providing an intuitive invoice approval portal, we enable receivable customers to accelerate cash flow while giving payors a transparent, controlled approval process integrated with their banking relationship.

## What We Are NOT

- **Not a full ERP system**: We focus on invoice approval and payment collection, not full accounting/ERP functionality
- **Not supporting all payment methods initially**: MVP focuses on ACH pre-approved debit only
- **Not targeting consumer payments**: Focus is B2B relationships between businesses
- **Not replacing core banking systems**: We extend existing online banking, not replace it
- **Not a marketplace**: We facilitate payments between existing business relationships, not connecting new buyers/sellers
- **Not international initially**: MVP scope is Canadian banking and payment rails
- **Not a lending/financing platform**: Focus is on payment collection, not working capital financing (for now)
- **Not a comprehensive invoicing suite**: We provide PDF invoice generation with templates, but not complex invoicing features like recurring billing automation or advanced tax calculations
