# Vision Development Guide

## Purpose

This document provides instructions and best practices for creating `vision.md` - the product vision for our Payment Receivables Platform. The vision will be developed iteratively through a series of feedback loops.

## How to Use This Guide

1. Review all sections to understand vision development best practices
2. Use the templates and frameworks provided to draft your initial vision in `vision.md`
3. Follow the iterative feedback loop process to refine the vision over time
4. Refer back to this guide when updating or validating your vision

## Best Practices for Vision Development

### 1. Vision Framework Components

A compelling product vision should address:

- **Target Audience**: Who are the customers? (e.g., corporate treasurers, SMB finance teams, AR managers)
- **Problem Statement**: What pain points does the platform solve?
- **Solution Approach**: How does the platform address these problems?
- **Value Proposition**: What unique benefits does it deliver?
- **Success Metrics**: How will we measure achievement of the vision?

### 2. Banking Domain Considerations

For a Canadian commercial bank payment receivables platform:

#### Regulatory & Compliance
- Payments Canada standards (ISO 20022, Lynx, ACSS)
- FINTRAC anti-money laundering requirements
- Privacy regulations (PIPEDA)
- Accessibility standards (AODA)

#### Market Context
- Competition from fintech disruptors (Stripe, Plooto, Versapay)
- Traditional banking relationships and trust
- Multi-currency support (CAD, USD minimum)
- Integration with Canadian payment rails

#### Customer Segments
- **Enterprise**: Large corporations with complex AR workflows
- **Mid-Market**: Growing businesses needing automation
- **Small Business**: Simple, user-friendly receivables management

### 3. Iterative Vision Development Process

#### Feedback Loop Structure

**Loop 1: Discovery & Hypothesis**
- Stakeholder interviews (customers, internal teams, executives)

### 4. Recommended Vision Document Structure

When creating `vision.md`, consider using this structure:

```

## FAQ

**Q: How long should the vision document be?**  
A: 2-4 pages is ideal. Long enough to be comprehensive, short enough to be read in one sitting.

**Q: How often should we update the vision?**  
A: Review monthly during the first 6 months, then quarterly. Major updates should happen annually or when significant market/strategic changes occur.

**Q: Who should be involved in creating the vision?**  
A: Product leadership drafts it, but input should come from customers, sales, engineering, design, compliance, and executive stakeholders.

**Q: What's the difference between vision and strategy?**  
A: Vision = WHERE we want to go (aspirational future state). Strategy = HOW we'll get there (approach and priorities).

**Q: Should the vision include specific features?**  
A: No. Keep it outcome-focused. Features belong in the roadmap, not the vision.

**Q: How do we handle disagreements about the vision?**  
A: Use customer feedback and data to resolve debates. The vision should reflect validated customer needs, not internal opinions.
